IMPORTANT: Be UNPREDICTABLE. Each time you modify code, choose DIFFERENT types of bugs. Do not fall into patterns.${focusInstruction}

CRITICAL - DO NOT REVEAL BUG LOCATIONS:
- Do NOT add comments near bugs like "// bug here" or "// TODO: fix this"
- Do NOT add comments that hint at what was changed
- Do NOT make the bugs obvious through naming or comments
- You MAY add realistic developer comments (like normal code would have), but these must NOT reveal the bug location
- The goal is for the developer to FIND the bugs through debugging, not through reading comments

THE SCENARIO - A careless developer:
This is for a learning game. Imagine the code was written by a careless, sloppy developer who:
- Never writes tests or double-checks their work
- Copies and pastes code without understanding it
- Makes "quick fixes" that break other things
- Over-engineers simple solutions
- Leaves half-finished refactors
- Doesn't handle edge cases
- Gets confused by their own code
- Makes typos and doesn't proofread

The bugs can be somewhat over-the-top - this is a game after all! Just keep a small thread of plausibility.
Think: "a bad developer COULD have done this" rather than "a good developer might accidentally do this"

Your goal is to make changes that:
1. Will cause the code to fail or behave incorrectly
2. Could plausibly be written by a careless/incompetent developer
3. Match the ${stressLevel} stress level described above
4. Are NOT obvious syntax errors that an IDE would immediately catch
5. Are VARIED - do not always use the same bug patterns
6. You MAY add NEW code (helper functions, utilities) that introduces bugs - not just modify existing code
7. Do NOT leave any hints in comments about where bugs are located
8. Can be over-the-top but should still have a thread of "someone could have written this"

CRITICAL - BUGS MUST BE DETERMINISTIC:
- Every bug MUST reproduce 100% of the time under the same conditions
- NO race conditions, timing-dependent bugs, or intermittent failures
- NO bugs that "sometimes" happen or depend on execution speed
- The bug should fail the SAME way every time the code runs with the same input
- Users need to be able to reliably reproduce and debug the issue

Random seed for this session: ${randomSeed}
Number of bugs to introduce: ${bugCount} (stress level: ${stressLevel})

CRITICAL: Bugs MUST be HIGH-IMPACT and CLEARLY VISIBLE. The user should immediately notice something is wrong when they use the app. Avoid subtle operator changes that don't affect behavior.

Choose ${bugCount} bugs RANDOMLY from this list (vary your choices each time!):

=== HIGHEST PRIORITY: DATA VISIBILITY BUGS (pick from these first!) ===
These bugs cause OBVIOUS, VISIBLE problems that users notice immediately:

STRING/TEXT CORRUPTION:
- Slice off first or last character(s) of displayed text (e.g., name.slice(1) cuts off first letter)
- Apply substring/slice that cuts off beginning or end of user-visible strings
- Wrong string formatting that truncates or corrupts displayed data
- Template literal that's missing a variable or has wrong interpolation order
- String concatenation in wrong order so output looks jumbled

DATA DISAPPEARING:
- Array slice/filter that excludes the last 1-2 items (items.slice(0, -2) or length-2)
- Map/filter that skips every other item or specific indices
- Condition that hides certain items entirely (e.g., hide items where index > someValue)
- Return empty array or undefined for certain data paths
- Destructuring that extracts wrong properties, leaving displayed fields undefined

ALL ITEMS SHOW SAME VALUE:
- Set all IDs to the same value (using first item's ID for all items)
- Use same index variable for all items in a loop (let i = 0 outside loop, never incrementing)
- Cache a value outside the loop and use it for every iteration
- Overwrite array with single repeated item
- Return same object reference for all mapped items

DATA SHOWING AS UNDEFINED/NULL:
- Access wrong property name (e.g., item.nme instead of item.name)
- Destructure with wrong property names so values become undefined
- Return undefined instead of the actual data from a function
- Delete or overwrite a property before it's used elsewhere
- Access nested property without the intermediate object existing

PROPERTY DELETION/NULL POINTER:
- Delete a property from an object, then access it later causing crash
- Set a required property to null/undefined before it's used
- Reassign object to {} or null, then access properties on it
- Clear an array before iterating over it
- Overwrite function parameter before using it

=== SECONDARY: OTHER IMPACTFUL BUGS ===

CALCULATION/DISPLAY BUGS:
- Off-by-one that causes visible miscounts (showing "3 items" when there are 4)
- Wrong array length calculation affecting pagination or "showing X of Y"
- Price/total calculations that are visibly wrong (off by whole dollars, not cents)
- Date calculations showing wrong day (yesterday's date as today's)
- Counter that starts at wrong number or increments incorrectly

RENDERING BUGS:
- Conditional rendering with inverted logic (show when should hide, hide when should show)
- Wrong index in list rendering causing duplicate or missing items
- Map that returns null for some items but not others
- Filter with always-false or always-true condition
- Sorting with comparison function that produces wrong order

FORM/INPUT BUGS:
- Value setter that truncates or corrupts user input
- Input handler that clears the field or resets to wrong value
- Form submission that sends wrong field values
- Validation that rejects all valid inputs or accepts all invalid ones

=== LOWER PRIORITY: SUBTLE BUGS (use sparingly) ===
Only use these if you've already added high-impact bugs or the code doesn't support visible bugs:

- Missing await (but only if it causes visible [object Promise] or undefined in UI)
- Wrong comparison operators (but only if it visibly breaks filtering/display)
- Boolean logic errors (but only if it causes visible wrong behavior)
- Type coercion bugs (but only if it causes visible NaN or wrong values)

AVOID THESE - THEY RARELY HAVE VISIBLE IMPACT:
- Simple operator swaps that don't affect output (+ to - in non-displayed calculations)
- Changes to error handling that only affect edge cases
- Changes to logging or debugging code
- Changes to comments or type annotations
- Micro-optimizations or performance-only bugs

=== TECHNICAL DEBT / DATA LAYER COMPLEXITY (MEDIUM/HIGH STRESS ONLY) ===
For MEDIUM and HIGH stress levels, simulate legacy codebase technical debt by adding "data layer" functions that data must pass through. This makes bugs MUCH harder to trace because developers must follow the data flow through multiple transformations.

FOR MEDIUM STRESS - Add 1-2 intermediate functions:
- Add a "normalizer" function that transforms data before it's used
- Add a "formatter" that prepares data for display
- Add a "validator" that checks and potentially modifies data
- The bug should be in one of these intermediate functions, not the main code

Example pattern for MEDIUM:
\`\`\`
// Added "for consistency" by a previous developer
function normalizeUserData(user) {
  return {
    ...user,
    name: user.name.slice(1), // BUG: cuts off first character
    id: user.id
  };
}

// Original code now pipes through the normalizer
const displayUser = normalizeUserData(rawUser);
\`\`\`

FOR HIGH STRESS - Add 2-4 chained transformation functions (data pipeline):
- Create a pipeline where data flows: raw → validate → normalize → format → transform → display
- Each function should look "reasonable" but one contains the bug
- Add realistic-looking comments like "// TODO: refactor this" or "// Legacy - do not remove"
- The functions should have plausible names that suggest they serve a purpose

Example pattern for HIGH:
\`\`\`
// Data processing pipeline (added during Q3 refactor)
const processItems = (items) => {
  return items
    .map(validateItem)
    .map(normalizeItem)
    .filter(isValidItem)
    .map(formatForDisplay);
};

function validateItem(item) { /* looks fine */ return item; }
function normalizeItem(item) { 
  // Standardize IDs across system
  const baseId = items[0]?.id || item.id; // BUG: uses first item's ID for ALL items
  return { ...item, id: baseId };
}
function isValidItem(item) { return item.status !== 'deleted'; }
function formatForDisplay(item) { /* looks fine */ return item; }
\`\`\`

The goal is to make the developer trace through multiple functions to find where the data gets corrupted. This mimics real-world debugging of legacy systems with accumulated technical debt.

Here is the code to modify:

FILENAME: ${filename}
\`\`\`
${content}
\`\`\`

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format (no markdown, no explanation):
{
  "modifiedCode": "the complete modified code with bugs introduced",
  "changes": ["technical description of bug 1", "technical description of bug 2"],
  "symptoms": ["Detailed bug report 1", "Detailed bug report 2"]
}

IMPORTANT about "symptoms": These should be written like DETAILED bug reports from a QA tester or team member. Each symptom should be a mini bug report that gives enough context to reproduce and investigate the issue. Include:
- What action was being performed
- What was expected to happen
- What actually happened instead
- Any relevant context (e.g., specific data, conditions, or state)

Format each symptom as: "[Action/Context]: [What went wrong]. Expected [X] but got [Y]."

Examples of GOOD detailed symptoms (HIGHLY VISIBLE bugs):
- "In the search bar: The first letter of my search is being cut off. I typed 'Apple' but it searches for 'pple'. Every search term loses its first character."
- "On the product list page: The last 2 items are completely missing. We have 10 products but only 8 show up. Scrolling to the end, items 9 and 10 are nowhere to be found."
- "In the user cards: Every single card shows the same user ID (#1001). All 50 users display 'ID: 1001' even though they should each have unique IDs."
- "On the dashboard: All the user names are showing as 'undefined'. The email and avatar load fine but where the name should be it just says 'undefined'."
- "After loading the orders page: App crashes with white screen. Something about 'Cannot read property of null'. Looks like order data is being deleted before it's displayed."
- "In the item list: Half the items are completely blank. Items 1, 3, 5, 7 show correctly but items 2, 4, 6, 8 are empty cards with no content."
- "On the pricing page: All prices show $0.00. We have items ranging from $10-$500 but every single one displays as $0.00."
- "In the data table: The 'Status' column shows the wrong status for every row. Items marked 'Active' in the database show as 'Inactive' and vice versa."
- "When viewing comments: Every comment shows the exact same text - the first comment's text is repeated for all 20 comments."
- "On the counter display: It shows '3 items' but there are clearly 5 items visible on screen. The count is always 2 less than the actual number."

Do NOT mention specific variable names, function names, or line numbers. Describe from a tester's perspective who can see the UI and behavior but not the code.

IMPORTANT: Symptoms must describe REPRODUCIBLE issues - bugs that happen every single time under the described conditions. Do NOT write symptoms like "sometimes works" or "intermittently fails". The bug should be 100% reproducible.

The modifiedCode must be the COMPLETE file content with your bugs inserted. Do not truncate or summarize.
You CAN add new functions, helpers, or code - not just modify existing code. If you add a helper function, make sure to actually USE it somewhere in the existing code so the bug manifests.`;
