# 🔥 stresst

**Stress test your developers with AI-generated bugs**

stresst is a developer training tool that uses AI to introduce realistic, subtle bugs into code. Perfect for:

- 🎓 **Training junior developers** to improve debugging skills
- 🧪 **Code review practice** - can you spot the bugs?
- 🎮 **Gamified learning** - compete to find and fix bugs fastest
- 📋 **Interview preparation** - practice real-world debugging scenarios

## How It Works

1. **Connect your GitHub account** - stresst uses OAuth to access your repositories
2. **Select a repository and branch** - choose the code you want to stress
3. **Pick a commit** - select which files to introduce bugs into
4. **Configure stress level** - Low (1-2 bugs), Medium (2-3 bugs), or High (3-5 bugs)
5. **Create stressed branch** - AI analyzes your code and introduces realistic bugs
6. **Share with your team** - send the bug report to a colleague to debug

## Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Bug Generation
Uses Claude AI to introduce subtle, realistic bugs that developers actually make:
- Off-by-one errors
- Null pointer issues
- Async/await mistakes
- Logic inversions
- Missing error handling
- And many more...

### 📊 Configurable Stress Levels
- **🌱 Low** - 1-2 straightforward bugs, easier to spot
- **🔥 Medium** - 2-3 subtle bugs, requires careful review
- **💀 High** - 3-5 devious bugs, may include spaghetti code

### 🎯 Focus Areas
Optionally specify what you want to test (e.g., "async/await", "null handling", "array bounds")

### 🔔 Bug Reports
Automatic notifications with user-friendly symptom descriptions:
- "The posts are showing up blank"
- "The app crashes when I select an item"
- "Some users' names are showing as 'undefined'"

### 📋 Easy Sharing
Copy bug reports to clipboard to share with colleagues via email or Slack

### 🗑️ Branch Management
Delete stressed branches when you're done to keep your repository clean

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A GitHub account
- An Anthropic API key (for AI-powered bug generation)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# GitHub OAuth (create at https://github.com/settings/developers)
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret

# Auth.js secret (generate with: npx auth secret)
AUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret

# Anthropic API key (get at https://console.anthropic.com)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

### GitHub OAuth Setup

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click "New OAuth App"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Application name**: stresst (or your preferred name)
   - **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env.local`

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stresst.git
cd stresst

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to get started.

## Usage

### Creating a Stressed Branch

1. Sign in with your GitHub account
2. Select a repository from the dropdown
3. Choose a branch to base the stressed version on
4. Click on a commit to see the changed files
5. Click "Stress this Commit"
6. Configure:
   - Branch name suffix (optional)
   - Stress level (Low/Medium/High)
   - Focus area (optional)
7. Click "Create & Stress"
8. Wait for the AI to introduce bugs
9. Share the bug report with your team!

### Finding the Bugs

Once a stressed branch is created:

1. Click "Show Stressed Branch" to view the commits
2. Look for commits starting with "🔥" - these contain the bugs
3. Review the code changes and try to identify what's wrong
4. Compare with the original branch to verify your findings

### Cleaning Up

To delete a stressed branch:
1. Select the stressed branch
2. Click the "Delete" button next to the branch name
3. Confirm the deletion
